The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites interested developers to the August 2020 OGC API Sprint, to be held through remote participation/web-conferencing from 10th to 11th August 2020. The sprint will cover the draft [OGC API - Coverages](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/coverages) specification.

The draft [OGC API - Coverages - Part 1: Core](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/coverages) specification defines a Web API for publishing and accessing coverages that are modeled according to the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS), for example satellite imagery and digital elevation models. The draft OGC API - Coverages specification makes it easy for a client to request coverages, changing parameters such as the spatial extent and coordinate reference systems at the time of request. A server that implements the specification provides information about what coverages are available, and the functionality the server offers. OGC API - Coverages is expected to address use cases similar to those addressed by the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) standard.
